What if I told you a dashboard could tell the full story of a business—without saying a word?

That’s exactly what I aimed to do with this financial analysis project for Bhatt Stores.

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights key performance indicators like sales, profit, discount trends, and profit margins—across countries, segments, and products.

Here’s what I uncovered:

Sales grew +249% YoY, with Germany leading in profit margins (15.66%)

Channel Partners segment delivered the highest profit margin (73.13%)

Products like Paseo and VTT were top revenue drivers

Despite high discounts, profit margin dipped to 14.1%, down from 14.7%—a red flag worth exploring

This wasn’t just about visuals. It was about: ✅ Asking the right business questions
✅ Structuring clean, meaningful data stories
✅ Drawing insights that decision-makers can act on

Why I did this:
I wanted to bridge the gap between raw numbers and real business strategy. Building this dashboard helped me dive deeper into what truly drives business performance—not just trends, but why they happen.
